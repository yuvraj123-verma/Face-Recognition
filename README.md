# Face-Recognition

# Store Face Data.ipynb File 
It Recognize the face and Store the Landmarks of the face into the numpy Array
We Convert this numpy array into the 1 Dimensional array
And Store in file.npy file present in face_dataset


# Face Detection.ipynb
Face Detection.ipynb file Detect the landmarks of the face and
machine learning model find these face landmarks in the face_dataset
and Predict the person name

if landmarks match:
  Predicted Name display on the image
else:
  Display No Match Found

# Face Recognition Steps
Facial recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using their face. It captures, analyzes, and compares patterns based on the person's facial details.

1. The face detection process is an essential step in detecting and locating human faces in images and videos.
2. The face capture process transforms analog information (a face) into a set of digital information (data or vectors) based on the person's facial features.
3. The face match process verifies if two faces belong to the same person.
